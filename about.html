        <p class="about">Welcome to our website! My name is Eshaan Tripathi, and I'm a computer science engineering student at Chitkara University, Himachal Pradesh. This website is a product of my passion for technology and my desire to create a platform where you can access the latest news and updates conveniently.

        As a student deeply involved in the world of technology and information, I saw the need for a centralized hub for news across various domains. Thus, I embarked on this journey to create a user-friendly website that provides curated news articles tailored to your interests.

        My goal is not only to keep you informed but also to inspire and engage you with insightful content. As I continue to learn and grow, I am committed to enhancing this platform and bringing you more exciting features and updates in the future.

        Stay tuned as I work diligently to make your browsing experience more enjoyable and informative. Thank you for visiting and being a part of this journey!</p>
